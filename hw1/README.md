# hw1 Project

This project is a C++ application that demonstrates the use of utility functions and serves as a basic template for further development.

## Project Structure

```
hw1
├── src
│   └── main.cpp        # Entry point of the application
├── include
│   └── utils.h        # Header file for utility functions
├── Makefile            # Build instructions
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Building the Project

To build the project, navigate to the `hw1` directory and run the following command:

```
make
```

This will compile the source files and create the executable.

## Running the Application

After building the project, you can run the application with the following command:

```
./main
```

## Usage

This project serves as a starting point. You can add your own utility functions in `utils.h` and implement the main logic in `main.cpp`.
